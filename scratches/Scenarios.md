### Scenario identifying

Here are listed some different scenarios of our system to be usage.

#### Scenario 1

Ted is running late for a job interview since the bus engine failed, so he opens the PowerShare mobile application and searches for an available car around his current position within a radius of 700 meters. He finds that the nearest car is just 250 meters away, so he clicks the icon on the map corresponding to the chosen car and looks through the details screen; the car has 30% battery left but his destination is not far and from the estimation provided in the details he thinks the can make it, so he hits the "reserve" button, PayPal assures he can pay so the reservation is confirmed, he drops off the bus and starts walking towards the car **guided by the GPS(?)**. Arrived to the car, Ted clicks the "Open Car" button and enters the vehicle. Once inside the system asks Ted to scan the QR code on the car screen with the QR scanner featured in the PowerShare application. Once recognized, Ted is free to power up the car and start his ride. When Ted arrives to his destination he powers down the car and gets an on screen notification saying that he drove more than 2 kilometers, the car has less than the 20% of battery left and there's a charging station within 3 kilometers from his position, therefore he can take the car to the charging station and get a fine discount or can leave there the vehicle but this will cost him an increased fine. Ted has no time to take the car to the station so he decides to pay the penalty, he exits the car and the system takes care of locking it. The ride is successfully completed and Ted is charged for the right amount of money on his PayPal account.

#### Scenario 2

Gwen has invited some friends over for dinner, while eating they decide to go out for a beer later, so Gwen decides to book a car with the PowerShare application, John and Paula, her two friends, are not registered to the service yet; since Gwen wants to save money by taking two registered users with her, she asks them to download the application on their smartphone and proceed with the registration. Once opened the application they're asked if they want to login or to register, they choose the second and therefore insert valid credentials and receive their password via e-mail. Finished the dinner they go out, unfortunately Gwen forgets her driving license at home so they have to go back to get it and by the time they're back the reservation time expires and Gwen is charged with a fine for not having picked up the car in time. They proceed to book the same car again, since no other did it in the meantime, to get to it and step inside. Now the three scan the QR code with their smartphones and the system notifies Gwen that a discount will be applied on the cost of the trip. Once at destination they drop off the car and the system sends a notification warning that she left the car in a non safe area and therefore she has to keep paying with a reduced fare and must get back to the car in at most two hours. They are ok with that and walk inside the pub, again they loose track of time until Gwen's phone rings as she gets notified that two hours passed and she's getting to pay for them plus another fine for improper use of the service.

#### Scenario 3

Tony is preparing to go to his friend Matt, he's going to ride there with Matt's bike which he borrowed a week ago so he can give it back to him, after that they have to go to the shopping center at the boundaries of the city, so Tony decides to book a PowerShare car with the mobile application. He inserts Matt's house address into the system, specifies the radius for the research and books the most convenient car. Once at Matt's place the two go to pick the car up, once they are inside and the check in is done, they decide to select the "money saving option", after inserting their destination the system provides them with a suitable charging station to leave the car at. Luckily for them the charging station is inside the shopping center area so, once parked, they power the car down and get out, once outside they insert the plug in the specific socket and leave. The system notifies Tony with the payment details including the applied discount.
